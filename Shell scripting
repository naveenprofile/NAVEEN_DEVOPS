username@hostname$
Or:
root@hostname #
or simply as $ or #.
$ represents regular users and # represents the administrative user root. Root is the most
privileged user in a Linux system.

A shell script is a text file that typically begins with a shebang, as follows:
#!/bin/bash

Shebang is a line on which #! is prefixed to the interpreter path. /bin/bash is the
interpreter command path for Bash.

Execution of a script can be done in two ways. Either we can run the script as a
command-line argument to bash or we can grant execution permission to the script
so it becomes executable.

$ bash script.sh # Assuming script is in the current directory.
Or:
$ bash /home/path/script.sh # Using full path of script.sh.

$ chmod a+x script.sh
$ ./script.sh #./ represents the current directory
Or:
$ /home/path/script.sh # Full path of the script is used


In Bash, each command or command sequence is delimited by using a semicolon or a new
line. For example:
$ cmd1 ; cmd2
